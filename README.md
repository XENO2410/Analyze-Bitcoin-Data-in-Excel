# Bitcoin Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Bitcoin price data using advanced Excel skills. The process involves importing, cleaning, and exploring the dataset, and presenting findings with visualizations. The analysis aims to compare Bitcoin's performance and volatility with the S&P500 over the last year (2021).

## Project Workflow

### 1. Importing Data
- The project starts with importing the dataset provided by Manuela, the Head of Finance, which includes data on Bitcoin and the S&P500.
- The data is loaded into Excel for further analysis.

### 2. Cleaning Data
- The imported dataset is inspected for any inconsistencies, missing values, or errors.
- Necessary cleaning steps are performed to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data.

### 3. Exploring Data with Pivot Tables and Formulas
- Pivot tables and various Excel formulas are used to explore the numeric data.
- Key metrics such as average price, daily changes, and volatility are calculated for both Bitcoin and the S&P500.

### 4. Comparative Analysis
- The behavior of Bitcoin is compared to the S&P500, focusing on the last year (2021).
- The analysis highlights potential upsides and volatility of Bitcoin relative to the S&P500.

### 5. Visualizing Findings
- The findings from the analysis are communicated through various visualizations.
- Charts and graphs are created to effectively present the comparison between Bitcoin and the S&P500.
